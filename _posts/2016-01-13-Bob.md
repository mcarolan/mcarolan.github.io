title: A brief venture into Scalaz-Stream and http4s
---

Scalaz-Stream is a powerful, yet simple, stream processing library for Scala. It gives you some compelling tools to compose asynchronous programs.<br/><br/>In this post we&apos;ll build a RESTful HTTP service to control a Raspberry Pi robot: and through this gain an insight into the processing and concurrency model of Scalaz-Stream and http4s.

## But I don't have a robot to hand

Ah, not to worry. It's quick and cheap to cobble together a robot: you probably already have some parts. My first stab of one was built using a Chicken Tikka tub.

<h3>Choosing a Raspberry Pi</h3>
Your first task will be to choose a Raspberry Pi, there are a few trade-offs.
<ul>
<li>If you're not bothered about having a Camera Interface, consider the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/">Pi Zero</a></li>
<ul><li>It's really cheap</li><li>It's really small</li><li>It won't use much power</li></ul>
<li>If you want to use a camera module, and want a more powerful Pi for use in other projects consider the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">2 Model B</a></li>
<li>If you want a camera module, but want a smaller form factor and lower power consumption: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a-plus/">Model A+</a> will be your best bet</li>
</ul>

<h3>Building your bot</h3>
<p>Over to you! Cobbling parts together in the hope it'll achieve something is what makes Raspberry Pi projects fun.</p>
<p>I did cheat a bit when building mine, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/issues/38/">Issue 38 of MagPi</a> has an excellent article: "Raspberry Pi Robot for Â£50". This serves a great shopping list for parts. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/issues/38/">You can get the PDF version of the article for free on the MagPi website.</a></p>

<h2>OK, how do we control it with Scala?</h2>
No matter how you built your Raspberry Pi robot, chances are it's going to be controlled through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output">GPIO</a> pins. I used the <a href="https://www.piborg.org/picoborg">PicoBorg motor controller</a> produced by <a href="https://www.piborg.org">PiBorg</a>.

<p>2 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAtPHANEfQo">DC motors</a> are attached to the motor controller. Each DC motor is controlled digitally through an assigned GPIO pin. If the pin is high, the motor will start receiving current. If it's low, it will not get any current. Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The motors are being controlled digitally: they are either moving as fast as then can; or are stationary. There is no in-between state.</li>
<li>The motor controller I'm using doesn't provide a way to run the motors in reverse: so I'm only modeling forward, left, and right movement.</li>
</ul>
We've mentioned a couple of concepts here: let's model them in Scala:
{% highlight scala %}
sealed trait PinState
case object High extends PinState
case object Low extends PinState
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
There are 2 states we can cause a GPIO pin to enter: high (the Raspberry Pi will cause 5V of power to run into it), or low (no power will run into the pin).
</p><p>
How can we model the GPIO pin itself?
</p>
{% highlight scala %}
trait DigitalOutput {
  def enterState(state: PinState): Task[Unit]
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Well, we can say it's one of those: a <code>DigitalOutput</code>. This has a function which takes a desired state. It returns an effectful container, that when evaluated will cause the pin to enter the desired state.</p>
<p>I've used Task here, as it plays particularly nicely with Scalaz-Stream. It's worth checking out, think of it as a lazy Future. You can read more about it <a href="https://github.com/indyscala/scalaz-task-intro/blob/master/presentation.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, our robot has 2 of these DigitalOutput's: a left and a right motor. Let's model that:</p>
{% highlight scala %}
trait Controller {
  val leftMotor: DigitalOutput
  val rightMotor: DigitalOutput
}
{% endhighlight %}

We said that our robot can move: forward, left, and right. It will do this by putting the left and the right motor into specific <code>PinState</code>'s'. Let's make a function that takes:
<ul>
  <li>A controller</li>
  <li>A desired state for the left motor</li>
  <li>A desired state for the right motor</li>
</ul>
And returns an effectful container which when evaluated causes the motors to do what we wish:

{% highlight scala %}
class Action(leftMotorState: PinState, rightMotorState: PinState)
  extends ((Controller) => Task[Unit]) {

  def apply(controller: Controller): Task[Unit] =
    for {
      _ <- controller.leftMotor enterState leftMotorState
      _ <- controller.rightMotor enterState rightMotorState
    } yield ()

}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Cool. Now we can express, in terms of this function, all of the movements our robot is able to make:</p>
{% highlight scala %}
case object Forward extends Action(High, High)
case object Left extends Action(Low, High)
case object Right extends Action(High, Low)
case object Halt extends Action(Low, Low)
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, let's write another function that takes an instance of a <code>Controller</code>, and applies an <code>Action</code> to it:

{% highlight scala %}
def interpret(controller: Controller)(action: Action): Task[Unit] =
    for {
      _ <- Task { println(action) }
      _ <- action(controller)
    } yield ()
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This function is really important. When we partially apply this function (by giving only a <code>Controller</code> instance), we have a function we can feed <code>Action</code>'s into: causing our bot to move!</p>
<h3>Dude, you haven't implemented anything yet</h3>

Ah, yeah. You probably want to see how the <code>DigitalOutput</code> and <code>Controller</code> traits are implemented. They're actually pretty simple, they wrap around <a href="http://pi4j.com/">Pi4J</a>, a Java library for interacting with Raspberry Pi GPIO:

{% highlight scala %}
case class PiDigitalOutput(pin: GpioPinDigitalOutput) extends DigitalOutput {

  override def enterState(state: PinState): Task[Unit] = Task {
    state match {
      case High => pin.high()
      case Low => pin.low()
    }
  }

}

case class PiController(controller: GpioController) extends Controller {

  val leftMotor = PiDigitalOutput(controller.provisionDigitalOutputPin(
    RaspiPin.GPIO_07,
    PinState.LOW))

  val rightMotor = PiDigitalOutput(controller.provisionDigitalOutputPin(
    RaspiPin.GPIO_01,
    PinState.LOW))

}
{% endhighlight %}

## A brief introduction to Scalaz-Stream

<a href="https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2">Scalaz-Stream</a> (soon to be known as FS2: Functional Streams for Scala) is a streaming I/O library for Scala.

The main concept in Scalaz-Stream, is a <code>scalaz.stream.Process</code>. This represents a (possibly infinite!) stream of data of a type.

This data is always _pulled_ from a source. It can then be sliced and diced with the usual suspects (<code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, ...). Data can then arrive at a <code>Sink</code>: which is something that consumes it in some way, e.g. by:
<ul>
<li>Writing a record to a database</li>
<li>Sending an email</li>
<li>Altering the state of GPIO pins to cause 2 DC motors to drive a robot in a specific direction</li>
</ul>

### Declaring a source

Let's have a quick look at the type signature of <code>scalaz.stream.Process</code>:

{% highlight scala %}
Process[+F[_], A]
{% endhighlight %}

We need to provide 2 types to construct a <code>scalaz.stream.Process</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>+F[_]</code> - the side-effect container type our stream will encounter. Most of the time this will either be a <code>scalaz.concurrent.Task[_]</code> or <code>Nothing</code>.</li>
<li><code>A</code> - this is completely unconstrained. It is the type of data we will work with, e.g. <code>String</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Action</code>...</li>
</ul>
Our source is able to produce some data, in the context of some side-effect container type. Here is a function to read a line from standard input:

{% highlight scala %}
def readLine: Task[String] = Task { Console.readLine() }
{% endhighlight %}

We can now look at how to turn <code>readLine</code> into a <code>scalaz.stream.Process[Task, String]</code>.

{% highlight scala %}
/*
Construct a finite stream from readLine, where at most 1 piece of data can be pulled by a Sink
*/
val oneLine: Process[Task, String] = Process eval readLine

/*
Construct an infinite stream from readLine. A sink can repeatedly pull values, as this stream will never end: readLine will be repeatedly evaluated.
*/
val allTheLines: Process[Task, String] = Process repeatEval readLine
{% endhighlight %}

### Declaring a Sink

In Scalaz-Stream, <code>Sink</code> is actually just a <code>typedef</code> for a very specialised form of <code>scalaz.stream.Process</code>.

{% highlight scala %}
type Sink[+F[_], A] = Process[F, A => F[Unit]]
{% endhighlight %}

The first part of the type constructor is the same: it takes some side-effect container type like <code>scalaz.concurrent.Task</code>.
But, rather than being a stream of some unconstrained data type, it's of <code>A => F[Unit]</code>.

Looks overwhelming, but it makes sense if you look at how you'd usually expect the signature of some function that perform a side-effect against some data:

{% highlight scala %}
def sendWelcomeEmailTo(address: EmailAddress): Task[Unit] = ???
def storeOrderInDatabase(order: Order): Task[Unit] = ???
def appendToLogFile(line: String): Task[Unit] = ???
{% endhighlight %}

So, a <code>Sink</code> is just a (possibly infinite) stream of functions that take some data: and give you back a <code>F[Unit]</code>.
